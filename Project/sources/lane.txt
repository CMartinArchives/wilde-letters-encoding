Dear Sir
    I return
corrected proofs —
the title page,
dedication, play-bill 
etc. have not yet 
come — please 
send them. I
will not
require any
more proofs of
the play, but I
wish that the
reader w[oul]d. go
through the play
once and correct
any slips in the
use of "will"
and "shall" — 
my use of the
words is Celtic
not Saxon.

    With regard
to future arrangements
I think the plays
better remain with
Mr. Lane — at
Bodley Head — as
they form a series
that should not
be broken — 
Mr. Mathews might
have "The Portrait
of Mr. W.H." — and
this w[oul]d give an
opportunity of
making some alterations
in the issue and
price — 300 or 250 —
and 50 large paper
w[oul]d be better. Also
the book sh[oul]d be a
guinea. These, at
least, are
Mr. Ricketts' views.
This book should be
out by end of
October.

    I have to get
the Woman of No
Importance copyrighted
simultaneously in
America (please
mark copyright
as in Lady Windermere:
this is most
important) – and
am sending proofs
to New York. I
think the book can
be out by Sept. 15. 
when the play goes
on tour. I shall
tell my American
agent to wire
to me as soon as
copyright is
secured, so as to
have no delay.

    The play sh[oul]d
have a good sale 
at Liverpool — 
where it has been
lectured on, and
formed a text
for reckless
sermons.

    I have to thank
you for allowing
my wife to make
selections of phrases
for her anthology.

I remain
truly
