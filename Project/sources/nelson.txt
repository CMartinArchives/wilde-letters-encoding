Oscar Wilde (1854–1900)
Letter to the governor of Reading Gaol, Major J.O.
Nelson
1897

My name is here,
Mons. Sebastian Melmoth.

Dear Major Nelson,

	I had of course
intended to write to you as
soon as I had safely reached
French soil, to express, however
inadequately, my real feelings
of what you must let me
term, not merely sincere, but
affectionate gratitude to you
for your kindness and gentleness
to me in prison, and for the real
care that you took of me
at the end, when I was mentally
upset and in a state of very
terrible nervous excitement. You
must not mind my using the 
word ‘gratitude.’ I used to
think gratitude a burden to
carry. Now I know that it is
something that makes the heart 
lighter. The ungrateful man
is one who walks slowly with
feet and heart of lead. But
when one knows the strange
joy of gratitude to God and
man the earth becomes lovelier
to one, and it is a pleasure
to count up, not one’s wealth
but one’s debts, not the little
that one possesses, but the
much that one owes.
	I abstained from writing, 
however, because I was haunted by
the memory of the little
children, & the wretched 
half witted lad who was flogged
by the Doctor’s orders. I could
not have kept them out of
my letter, and to have mentioned
them to you might have put you
in a difficult position. In your
reply you might have expressed
sympathy with my views —I
think you would have — and then
on the appearance of my public 
letter you might have felt as
I had, in some almost
ungenerous or thoughtless
way, procured your private
opinion on official things, for
use as corroboration.

	I longed to speak to you
about these things on the
evening of my departure, but I
felt that in my position as a
prisoner it would have been
wrong of me to do so, and that
it would, or might have put
you in a difficult position
afterwards, as well as at the
time. I only hear of my
letter being published by a
telegram from Mr. Ross, but
I hope they have printed it in
full, as I tried to express
in it my appreciation and
admiration of your own humane
spirit and affectionate interest
in all the prisoners under
your charge. I did not wish
people to think that any
exception had been specially
made for me. Such exceptional 
treatment as I received was by 
order of the Commissioners.  You 
gave me the same kindness as
you gave to everyone. Of course
I made more demands, but
then I think I had really more
needs than others - and I lacked
often their cheerful acquiescence —

	Of course I side with
the prisoners — I was one, and
I belong to their class now —
I am not a scrap ashamed of
having been in prison. I am
horribly ashamed of the materialism
of the life that brought me
there. It was quite unworthy of an 
artist.

	Of Martin, and the subjects
of my letter I of course say
nothing at all, except that
the man who could change the
system — if any one man can
do so — is yourself. At present
I write to ask you to allow
me to sign myself, once at any
rate in life, your sincere and grateful friend,

Oscar Wilde.
