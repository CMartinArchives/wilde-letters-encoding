Dear Mrs Stannard

	Your kind husband
gave me a very sympathetic
and touching message
from you yesterday, for
which pray accept my
most sincere thanks : he
also asked me from you
to call, a privilege of
which I hope to avail
myself, tomorrow afternoon.

	Of course I have
passed through a very
terrible punishment - and 
have suffered the very
pitch of anguish and despair
Still I am conscious that
I was leading a life quite 
unworthy of an artist in
every way, and unworthy of a 
son of my dear mother whose
nobility of soul and intellect
you always appreciated, and
who was herself always one of
your warmest and most
enthusiastic admirers.
	
	I am living quietly in
a little auberge by the sea, and
for the moment am quite alone.
France has been charming to
me and about me during all
my imprisonment, and has now
- mother of all artists as she is -
given me asile. To escape the
foolish tongue and prying eye
I have for the moment taken the
name of
	Monsieur Sebastian Melmoth -
a curious name which I’ll
explain to you tomorrow.

	Pray let my name and place of
sejour be quite a secret to
all. I hope to live in solitude
and peace. Accept these few
verses as a slight token of my 
gratitude. Believe me yours,

Oscar Wilde
