## Project Description

This project presents the encoding structure for three letters written by **Oscar Wilde** between 1887 and 1899.  
The materials illustrate different dimensions of Wilde’s life and writing:  
a **professional letter** to *Wemyss Reid* about *The Lady’s World* (1887),  
a **spiritual extract** from *De Profundis* (1897),  
and a **personal letter** to *Robert Ross* (1899).  
Together, they trace Wilde’s intellectual evolution from the public aesthetic sphere to private reflection and moral self-awareness.

The goal of this first assignment was to design a valid XML structure and a consistent DTD inspired by TEI guidelines.  
The encoding focuses on core metadata — such as dates, places, correspondents, and works mentioned — while remaining flexible enough for future semantic enrichment.  
Elements like `<term>`, `<note>`, and `<ref>` anticipate further layers of annotation, for example to mark moral, aesthetic, or emotional vocabulary and to connect Wilde’s correspondence to digital repositories or critical editions.  
The project also explores how formal structure can mirror intellectual order: encoding becomes not only a technical act but a way of reading and interpreting a text.

## Why XML

Using XML makes it possible to represent the structure and meaning of Wilde’s letters in a consistent and sustainable way.  
It separates the textual content from its presentation, ensuring long-term preservation and interoperability with other digital editions.  
Encoding the correspondence in XML enables complex relationships between people, places, and ideas to be expressed hierarchically — making Wilde’s writing both **readable by humans** and **processable by machines**.

## AI Use Statement

I used generative AI (ChatGPT) to clarify DTD syntax, XML validation procedures, and project organisation.  
All encoding decisions, structural design, and final XML markup are my own work.
