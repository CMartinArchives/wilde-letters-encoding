## Project Overview

For this project I selected three manuscript letters written by **Oscar Wilde** between **1894 and 1897**. These years cover two very different periods in Wilde’s life: his active literary career, and the difficult months after his release from **Reading Gaol** in May 1897. The letters come from three different libraries, which also helped me understand how manuscript metadata can vary depending on cataloguing practices.

- **Letter to John Lane (1894)**: A publishing letter about proofs, print runs, copyright, and pricing.  
- **Letter to Major J. O. Nelson (1897)**: Written days after leaving prison, expressing gratitude and reflecting on prison life.  
- **Letter to Henrietta Stannard (1897)**: A private and discreet letter, where Wilde writes under the name *Sebastian Melmoth* and describes his quiet life in Berneval-sur-Mer.

Together, these letters show Wilde shifting from professional literary concerns to personal struggle and recovery.

## Materials and Method

For Assignment 1, my goal was to design a **DTD** that could represent the main structures of these letters. I focused on:

- identifying correspondents  
- describing letterheads and addresses  
- marking paragraphs and line breaks  
- representing names, places, and dates  
- including basic metadata

My DTD was intentionally simple because this was my first time building one. It captures the basic structure of a letter, but it does not yet support more advanced features like abbreviations, corrections, pseudonyms, or complex physical description.

## AI Use Statement

I used ChatGPT for help understanding XML syntax and for feedback while designing the DTD.  
All encoding decisions and the final design were made by me.
